# SmartCalcV2.0

SmartCalcV2.0 is an advanced calculator application developed using C++ and the Qt framework. The project leverages the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and supports reverse Polish notation (RPN) for efficient and powerful mathematical calculations.

### Technologies used:
* [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [QCustomPlot](https://www.qcustomplot.com/)

## Features

- Calculator functionality based on reverse Polish notation (RPN) for accurate and streamlined mathematical computations.

- Utilizes the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate concerns and enhance maintainability and extensibility of the codebase.

- User-friendly graphical interface developed using Qt, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users.

- Supports a wide range of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more.
